# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Create Slides for Week Week Thirteen in `slides/weekthirteen/index.qmd`

- [X] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [X] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the root of the repository
that explains the idea of a "Prosegrammer" and the concept of document
engineering. All the slides that you create have to specifically connect
to the theme of prosegramming and document engineering.
- [X] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the `syllabus` directory of
the repository that explains rules and regulations for this course on document
engineering. Note that these are the rules that students follow and not
specifically the rules and regulations that you follow as a coding agent.
- [X] Please remember that I am currently working on the slides in
`slides/weekthirteen/index.qmd` that introduce 

how to perform searching
and sorting. I created these slides for the algorithm analysis class
that I also teach. Here is what I need you to add to them:
    - One slide that explains the basics of the big-O notation
      that I use throughout other parts of this slide deck.
    - Big-picture slides that explain why searching and sorting are
      important operations in computer science and document engineering.
- [X] Here is what I need you to revise in the slides:
- [X] You can look at the other slide decks that I have already prepared:
  - `slides/weekone/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weektwo/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekthree/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfour/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfive/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeksix/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekeight/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeknine/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekten/index.qmd` ... and see how I am currently using Markdown
  and Quarto in my slides! There are also slides in other directories and you
can preview them as well.
- [X] Please do not use Markdown or Quarto formats that I am not currently
using in my slides to make sure that the content has a consistent format.
- [X] If you check the `index.qmd` file in this GitHub repository, you can see
a simple example of word frequency analysis. Please use simple examples like
this one to illustrate how to use containers like lists, tuples, and sets in
Python.
- [X] Make sure that all the content is accessible to beginners who do not have
extensive experience with programming or the documentation of a software tool.
- [X] Make sure that all the content has concrete examples that make points
clear to beginners. Provide simple summaries of the concrete code examples.
- [X] Always include "signposting" slides that clearly state what you are going
to explain in the next block of slides about a specific topic. These signposting
slides are at the `#` level in the Markdown file.
- [X] Keep the total number of slides to a count less than the prior slide
decks that I have created. For instance, this topic is less complicated than the
material that I produced for weeknine and thus the slide count should be less.
