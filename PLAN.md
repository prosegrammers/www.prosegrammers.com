# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Create Slides for Week Twelve in `slides/weektwelve/index.qmd`

- [ ] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [ ] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the root of the repository
that explains the idea of a "Prosegrammer" and the concept of document
engineering. All the slides that you create have to specifically connect to the
theme of prosegramming and document engineering.
- [ ] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the `syllabus` directory of
the repository that explains rules and regulations for this course on document
engineering. Note that these are the rules that students follow and not
specifically the rules and regulations that you follow as a coding agent.
- [ ] Please remember that I am currently working on the slides in
`slides/weektwelve/index.qmd` that introduce how to create and use regular
expressions for the purposes of document engineering. I want the slides to
define what a regular expression is an explain their benefits and drawbacks.
- [ ] I have already written some slides and I don't want you to delete them.
However, I need you to add more slides about tasks like:
    - Create a regular expression in Python
    - The various components of a regular expression in Python
    - How to use regular expressions in Python
    - How to perform pattern matching with a regular expression
    - How to use regular expressions in Python for document engineering
    - How to test a program (maybe use `unittest`) using a regex
    - Other simple and easy to understand topics about regex
- [ ] You can look at the other slide decks that I have already prepared:
  - `slides/weekone/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weektwo/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekthree/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfour/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfive/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeksix/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekeight/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeknine/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekten/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekeleven/index.qmd` ... and see how I am currently using Markdown
  and Quarto in my slides!
- [ ] Please do not use Markdown or Quarto formats that I am not currently
using in my slides to make sure that the content has a consistent format.
- [ ] If you check the `index.qmd` file in this GitHub repository, you can see
a simple example of word frequency analysis. Please use simple examples like
this one to illustrate how to use containers like lists, tuples, and sets in
Python.
- [ ] Make sure that all the content is accessible to beginners who do not have
extensive experience with programming or the documentation of a software tool.
- [ ] Make sure that all the content has concrete examples that make points
clear to beginners. Provide simple summaries of the concrete code examples.
- [ ] Always include "signposting" slides that clearly state what you are going
to explain in the next block of slides about a specific topic. These
signposting slides are at the `#` level in the Markdown file.
- [ ] Do not create slides that break the formatting or use icons that
do not exist. You should use short titles that fit on a single line.
You should use bullet points for ideas and make then short and clear.
- [ ] Keep the total number of slides to a count the same as the prior slide
decks that I have created.
