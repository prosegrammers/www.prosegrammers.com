## 1. What is FastAPI overall?

## 2. How well documented is FastAPI?

## 2a. Discuss overall layout in detail

# Automatic Interactive Documentation

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- States that FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI schemas from your code.
- Introduces the two documentation UIs , Swagger UI and ReDoc.
- Shows how different examples of each types
- Gives links to each types github
- Lacks indepth explantation of feature and differences between Swagger UI and ReDoc.

# High Performance

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- Explains its on par with NodeJS and GO
- You have to click two seperate links before getting to an explantation page
- Benchmarks are an outside website not on the actual FastAPI website.
- Lacks indepth explantation of why and how fast FastAPI actually is.
:::
# Dependency Injection

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- Introduces the Depends() system as a simple way to declare reusable logic.
- Demonstrates how dependencies can handle tasks like authentication, database sessions, or common parameters.
- Explains that dependencies can be nested, allowing complex logic to be broken into smaller reusable pieces.
- Emphasizes that dependency injection keeps code modular, testable, and easier to maintain.
- No link to dependency section of documention on features tab.
