## What is `FastAPI` overall?

- A Python tool for building web APIs.
- Uses Starlette for web handling and Pydantic for data checks.
- Type hints define what data an API accepts and returns.
- Designed to be fast, easy to learn, and good for both small and large projects.

# How well documented is `FastAPI`?

## Automatic Interactive Documentation

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- The docs clearly show how API docs are created automatically.
- Examples are easy to follow but often stay basic.
- Pages mix “how to do it” with “what it is.”
- Doesn’t clearly explain when to use Swagger UI vs. ReDoc.
- Mentions some helpful features, but misses deeper explanation or real-world
guidance.

:::


## High Performance

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- Explains it's on par with NodeJS and GO
- You have to click two separate links before getting to an explanation page
- Benchmarks are an outside website not on the actual FastAPI website.
- Lacks indepth explanation of why and how fast FastAPI actually is.

:::

## Dependency Injection

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- Introduces the Depends() system as a simple way to declare reusable logic.
- Demonstrates how dependencies can handle tasks like authentication, database
sessions, or common parameters.
- Explains that dependencies can be nested, allowing complex logic to be broken
into smaller reusable pieces.
- Emphasizes that dependency injection keeps code modular, testable, and easier
to maintain.
- No link to dependency section of documentation on features tab.

## Critique of Overall Documentation Features and Layout

### Strengths
::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- **Strong reference documentation**
  - Clear API signatures, parameters, defaults, and behavior.
  - Reliable for looking up low-level details.

- **Beginner-friendly introductory material**
  - Quickstart/tutorial content with runnable examples.
  - Clear demonstration through interactive docs.

### Weaknesses (Diátaxis Misalignments)

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- **Blurring of documentation modes**
  - Many pages mix tutorial, reference, and conceptual info.
  - Harder for readers to know *what type of help* a page provides.

- **Limited “Explanation” content**
  - Lacks deep discussion of architectural trade-offs or design philosophy
  - Makes advanced use harder to reason about.

:::

### Structural Gaps

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- No “documentation map” guiding users to:
  - *learn* (tutorials)
  - *do* (how-tos)
  - *understand* (explanations)
  - *look up* (reference)
- Docs scale well for small projects, but guidance diminishes for large / complex systems.
- Real-world patterns and best practices are scattered instead of clearly organized.

## Is FastAPI a Worthwhile Tool for Beginners?

### Overall Assessment

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- **Yes—kind of.**
  - The learning curve is gentle for small projects due to excellent beginner-oriented examples.
  - Type-hint-driven design gives immediate feedback and intuitive API creation.
  - The interactive docs make it easy for beginners to visualize results.

### Benefits for Beginners

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- Quick “first success”: build a working API in minutes.
- Automatic validation reduces trial-and-error.
- Clear, example-driven introductory material.

:::

---

### Challenges for Beginners

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- As projects grow, beginners may struggle:
  - Fewer conceptual explanations for *why* things work the way they do.
  - Less guidance on project structure, testing strategies, deployment patterns.
- Beginners transitioning to intermediate users may find gaps in “How-to” style documentation.

## Minor Comparison: FastAPI vs. Django Documentation

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- **Django has more mature Diátaxis structure:**
  - Clear separation between tutorials, topic guides, reference, and how-tos.
  - Rich conceptual explanations (for things like tool architecture)
  - Strong real-world “how-tos”.

:::
---

### How FastAPI Differs

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- FastAPI is easier to *start* with, but Django is easier to *grow* with.
- FastAPI’s docs favor code-first examples while Django’s favors structured learning.
- Django’s documentation ecosystem is extensive while FastAPI’s is still growing.

:::

## Overview of strengths of FastAPI docs
::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- Very clear and easy to read.
- Simple examples that work immediately.
- Built-in interactive API docs explained well.
- Good beginner-friendly introductions.
- Frequently updated and maintained.

:::

## Overview of weaknesses of FastAPI docs

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}

- Some topics feel lightly explained.
- Advanced patterns lack clear guidance.
- Large-project advice is limited.
- Dependency system needs deeper examples.
- Sections sometimes mix concepts and tutorials.
