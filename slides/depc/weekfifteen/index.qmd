## 1. What is FastAPI overall?

## 2. How well documented is FastAPI?

## 2a. Discuss overall layout in detail

# Automatic Interactive Documentation

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- States that FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI schemas from your code.
- Introduces the two documentation UIs , Swagger UI and ReDoc.
- Shows how different examples of each types
- Gives links to each types github
- Lacks indepth explantation of feature and differences between Swagger UI and ReDoc.
:::

# High Performance

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- Explains its on par with NodeJS and GO
- You have to click two seperate links before getting to an explantation page
- Benchmarks are an outside website not on the actual FastAPI website.
- Lacks indepth explantation of why and how fast FastAPI actually is.
:::
# Dependency Injection

::: {.incremental .fade-right style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.775em;"}
- Introduces the Depends() system as a simple way to declare reusable logic.
- Demonstrates how dependencies can handle tasks like authentication, database sessions, or common parameters.
- Explains that dependencies can be nested, allowing complex logic to be broken into smaller reusable pieces.
- Emphasizes that dependency injection keeps code modular, testable, and easier to maintain.
- No link to dependency section of documention on features tab.

## Critique of Overall Documentation Features and Layout

### Strengths
- **Strong reference documentation**
  - Clear API signatures, parameters, defaults, and behavior.
  - Reliable for looking up low-level details.
  
- **Beginner-friendly introductory material**
  - Quickstart/tutorial content with runnable examples.
  - Clear demonstration through interactive docs.

---

### Weaknesses (Diátaxis Misalignments)
- **Blurring of documentation modes**
  - Many pages mix tutorial, reference, and conceptual info.
  - Harder for readers to know *what type of help* a page provides.

- **Limited “Explanation” content**
  - Lacks deep discussion of architectural trade-offs or design philosophy
  - Makes advanced use harder to reason about.

---

### Structural Gaps
- No “documentation map” guiding users to:  
  - *learn* (tutorials)  
  - *do* (how-tos)  
  - *understand* (explanations)  
  - *look up* (reference)
- Docs scale well for small projects, but guidance diminishes for large / complex systems.
- Real-world patterns and best practices are scattered instead of clearly organized.

## Is FastAPI a Worthwhile Tool for Beginners?

### Overall Assessment
- **Yes—kind of.**
  - The learning curve is gentle for small projects due to excellent beginner-oriented examples.
  - Type-hint-driven design gives immediate feedback and intuitive API creation.
  - The interactive docs make it easy for beginners to visualize results.

---

### Benefits for Beginners
- Quick “first success”: build a working API in minutes.
- Automatic validation reduces trial-and-error.
- Clear, example-driven introductory material.

---

### Challenges for Beginners
- As projects grow, beginners may struggle:
  - Fewer conceptual explanations for *why* things work the way they do.
  - Less guidance on project structure, testing strategies, deployment patterns.
- Beginners transitioning to intermediate users may find gaps in “How-to” style documentation.

---

## Minor Comparison: FastAPI vs. Django Documentation
- **Django has more mature Diátaxis structure:**
  - Clear separation between tutorials, topic guides, reference, and how-tos.
  - Rich conceptual explanations (for things like tool architecture)
  - Strong real-world “how-tos”.

---

### How FastAPI Differs
- FastAPI is easier to *start* with, but Django is easier to *grow* with.
- FastAPI’s docs favor code-first examples while Django’s favors structured learning.
- Django’s documentation ecosystem is extensive while FastAPI’s is still growing.
