# Retrieval augmented generation

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.70em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What is NLP for document
engineering?**
    - Breaking text into meaningful units
    - Extracting key information from documents
    - Analyzing language patterns
    - Building tools to understand written content

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book >}} **What are this week's highlights?**
    - A "from scratch" implementation of several key NLP techniques:
        - Tokenization and segmentation
        - Stemming and lemmatization
        - Keyword extraction and frequency analysis
        - Build keyword in context tools

# Key insights for prosegrammers

::: {.fragment .boxed-content .fade style="font-size: 1.0em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid gears >}} Natural language processing transforms raw
text into structured data that programs can more easily analyze
- {{< iconify fa6-solid book >}} Although great packages exist, simple
algorithms handle common NLP tasks without external libraries
- {{< iconify fa6-solid code >}} Understanding basic NLP helps prosegrammers
build their own powerful document analysis tools

## Course learning objectives

::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=true title="Learning Objectives for
Document Engineering"}

- **CS-104-1**: Explain processes such as software installation or
design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging
from inexperienced to expert.
- **CS-104-2**: Use professional-grade integrated development
environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to
compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and
industry-standard documentation tools.
- **CS-104-3**: Build automated publishing pipelines to format, check,
and ensure both the uniformity and quality of digital documents.
- **CS-104-4**: Identify and apply appropriate conventions of a variety
of technical communities, tools, and computer languages to produce
industry-consistent diagrams, summaries, and descriptions of technical
topics or processes.

## Key takeaways for prosegrammers

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: 0.1em; font-size: 0.7em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid scissors >}} **Master text processing
fundamentals**
  - Tokenization splits text into analyzable units
  - Segmentation divides documents into sentences and paragraphs
  - Stemming and lemmatization normalize word forms

- {{< iconify fa6-solid chart-bar >}} **Build powerful analysis tools**
  - Word frequency reveals document themes and patterns
  - Stop word removal focuses on meaningful content
  - Keyword extraction identifies important terms automatically

- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **Understand context and usage**
  - KWIC displays show how words are used in practice
  - Combine techniques to build sophisticated document tools
  - Simple algorithms handle many real-world NLP tasks
