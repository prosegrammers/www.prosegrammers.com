# Digital Gardening

<!--- DJ -->
## Introduction
-A Next.js site that curates evolving “digital gardens,” displaying interlinked MDX-based notes.

-Uses next-mdx-remote to render MDX, with TailwindCSS for styling and a layout wrapper.

-Includes key views: homepage highlighting gardens/tools, directory of all gardens, and dynamic slug pages for individual entries.

## Origins and Context
-Rooted in digital gardening concepts from Mike Caulfield, later expanded by Tom Critchlow, Joel Hooks, and Maggie Appleton.

-Inherits practices from wikis, Zettelkasten, and knowledge-graph systems emphasizing non-linear, incremental publishing.

-Technically grounded in the MDX + static-site ecosystem (Next.js, Gatsby, Jekyll) and supports bidirectional linking.

-Designed to showcase notable digital gardens, tools, and the philosophies behind networked note-taking.

-Acts as a starter kit for writers, researchers, and developers building evolving, public knowledge bases.

-README.md serves as a theory-and-tools hub, providing examples and foundations for new garden structures.

-Future facing stack prepared for enhancements like Algolia search (via build-search.js), expanded content, and richer metadata.
