# Digital Gardening

<!--- DJ -->
## Introduction
-A Next.js site that curates evolving “digital gardens,” displaying interlinked MDX-based notes.

-Uses next-mdx-remote to render MDX, with TailwindCSS for styling and a layout wrapper.

-Includes key views: homepage highlighting gardens/tools, directory of all gardens, and dynamic slug pages for individual entries.

## Origins and Context
-Rooted in digital gardening concepts from Mike Caulfield, later expanded by Tom Critchlow, Joel Hooks, and Maggie Appleton.

-Inherits practices from wikis, Zettelkasten, and knowledge-graph systems emphasizing non-linear, incremental publishing.

-Technically grounded in the MDX + static-site ecosystem (Next.js, Gatsby, Jekyll) and supports bidirectional linking.

-Designed to showcase notable digital gardens, tools, and the philosophies behind networked note-taking.

-Acts as a starter kit for writers, researchers, and developers building evolving, public knowledge bases.

-README.md serves as a theory-and-tools hub, providing examples and foundations for new garden structures.

-Future facing stack prepared for enhancements like Algolia search (via build-search.js), expanded content, and richer metadata.

## Core Principle: Ever Evolving Content
A digital garden treats ideas as ongoing projects rather than final products. Notes are regularly updated as your understanding deepens, allowing concepts to grow gradually. Instead of aiming for perfection, the focus is on continual refinement and long term learning.

## Core Principle: Networked Structure
Digital gardens use links to connect related ideas, forming a web rather than a linear feed. This structure mirrors how people actually think, making it easier to see relationships, trace influences, and follow curiosity across topics.

## Core Principle: Atomic Notes
Information is broken into small, focused pieces that each cover a single idea. These atomic notes are easier to write, update, and connect. Over time, they create a rich, modular knowledge system that can be reused and recombined in different ways.

## Core Principle: Transparency and Work in Progress
Gardens make it normal to share drafts, half formed thoughts, and evolving ideas. This transparency highlights the process behind learning rather than hiding it. Readers can watch ideas unfold, and creators can experiment without pressure to be polished.

## Core Principle: Flexible Navigation
Instead of scrolling through posts in chronological order, readers can explore through tags, links, maps, or graphs. This flexibility allows people to move through the garden in any direction, discovering new connections and building their own paths through the material.

## Why Digital Gardening Matters
- Share your ideas as they grow, not just when they're "perfect"
- Connect your thoughts together like a web, not a timeline
- Learn and share at the same time
- Build your own personal Wikipedia

## Anatomy of a Digital Garden
- A collection of notes that link to each other
- Some notes are new ideas, others are fully developed
- Pages grow and change over time
- Easy to jump between related topics

## Tools and How to Build One
- Use note apps like Obsidian or Notion
- Publish with simple tools like Quartz
- Start with just text files and links
- Add fancy features later if you want

## Challenges
- It feels weird to share unfinished ideas
- Setting up the tech can be tricky
- Hard to stay consistent with updating
- Easy to spend more time organizing than writing

## Who Benefits
- Students organizing their learning
- Writers working through ideas
- Anyone who wants to share what they're learning
- People tired of traditional blogs

## Conclusion
